I'm a senior PhD candidate at the University of Delaware, specializing in the exciting fields of static analysis, dynamic analysis, fuzzing, and memory security.

üõ† I've designed a powerful static analysis checker called Palfrey, tailored to detect use-after-free bugs. This innovative tool is built on the LLVM framework, and you can find its source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/wtismyza/Palfrey).

My contributions to the academic world include several published papers, covering a range of topics:

- "All Use-After-Free Vulnerabilities Are Not Created Equal: An Empirical Study on Their Characteristics and Detectability" (RAID 2023), co-authored with Daiping Liu, Jidong Xiao, and Haining Wang.
- "CAUSEC: Cache-based Secure Key Computation with (Mostly) Deprivileged Execution" (ICDCS 2023) authored by Shariful Alam, Le Guan, Zeyu Chen, Haining Wang, and Jidong Xiao.
- "A Processing-In-Memory Implementation of SHA-3 Using a Voltage-Gated Spin Hall-Effect Driven MTJ-based Crossbar" (Great Lakes Symposium on VLSI, May 2019).
- "A Study of Account Recovery in the Wild and Its Security Implications" (IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing, June 2019).

Teaching is another passion of mine, and I've had the opportunity to serve as a Teaching Assistant at the University of Delaware for the following courses:

- CPEG 695: Digital Forensics (2018, 2019, 2022, and 2023).
- ELEG 222: Microprocessor System (2018).
- ELEG 312: Circuit Analysis (2019).
- CPEG 650: Advanced Cybersecurity (2022, 2023).


In the summer of 2023, I had the privilege of working as an intern at Kryptowire Lab in Arlington, Virginia. During my internship, I contributed to the secure design of 5G technologies, exploring the exciting world of cybersecurity in a real-world context.
