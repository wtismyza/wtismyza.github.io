- Conducted fuzz testing on 30 use-after-free (UAF) bugs with 10 distinct patterns, using eight state-of-the-art fuzzers. 
- Assessed each fuzzerâ€™s performance in terms of time and memory overhead, as well as their success rates in detecting the identified bugs.
- Developed optimization techniques to enhance fuzzer detection capabilities based on our analysis of the root causes of the bugs, aimed to improve the coverage and efficiency of the fuzzing process.
